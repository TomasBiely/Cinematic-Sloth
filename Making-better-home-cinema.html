 <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">Wondering how to improve your movie watching experience? 
     Consider your movie setup. Is it good for long watching periods? The most important aspects are:</p></div>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Be comfortable</li>
    <li>Don’t hurt your back</li>
    <li>Be able to reliably use your setup every time</li>
    <li>Limit your distractions</li>
</ol>
<br>

<div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">Let's cover these aspects one by one.</p></div>
<br><br>
    <div class="Subtitle2">1. Be comfortable</div>
    <br>
    <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">
        This might seem kind of obvious and unnecessary to mention but if we would stick to just
         point 2 and 3, we might forget that this should be an enjoyable experience. 
         So, choosing a comfortable sofa chair over an office chair might be a good idea 
         when watching movies (but of course not such a good idea when doing a work setup). 
         Take inspiration from actual movie cinemas. What kind of chairs do they have there, how close can you come to that?
         <br><br>
         You can find cheap or free furniture on Facebook marketplace and other websites 
         with used stuff. So, if you feel like you don’t have a place to watch movies comfortably, it might be worth considering.
         <br><br>
         I know a lot of people (myself included) sometimes watch movies in bed, which can be fine and relaxing.
        But it can also cause back pain and disturb your sleep. You probably heard before that your 
        bed should be a place only meant for sleep. If you do other things in bed, you might 
        associate that activity with lying in bed, which can make it harder to put away your devices 
        and fall asleep. So, if you can avoid it, try having a movie/entertainment setup, that's solely used for this purpose.
    </p></div><br>

    <div class="Subtitle2">2. Don’t Hurt your back</div>
    <br>
    <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">
        Another tip is to keep long movie-watching/sitting sessions as healthy as possible. 
        This can be achieved by having a chair or sofa that supports your back and doesn't 
        urge you to be hunched over or strain your neck. It is also a good idea to not stay 
        in one position for a long period of time. Before and after you watch a movie, try 
        taking a walk or stretch a bit (also a personal tip: stare into the distance to force 
        your eyes to not just focus on a screen that is close to you but on something that is far away, 
        this can help relax your eyes).
        </p></div>
        <br><br>
    <div class="Subtitle2">3. Be able to reliably use your setup every time</div>
    <br>
    <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">
        This might sound weird, but it's based on something I've read recently. 
        It only applies if you really like and want to watch movies. If you're trying
         to do other stuff and take a break from watching, it might be a good idea to do
          the opposite. It's basically that your setup is permanent and associated with watching movies. 
          Meaning you don't always watch movies in a different manor, but that you stick with your specific
          routine. For example, always watching a movie on a Saturday at 8pm, in your room on your laptop, 
          sitting on a sofa chair and turning your phone off, etc... This allows you to create a habit which
           can turn your focus on to the actual movie you're choosing to watch and your experience of it, 
           rather than focusing on the things mentioned before.
        </p></div> <br><br>

        <div class="Subtitle2">4. Limit your distractions</div>
        <br>
        <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">
            Like I hinted above, having a distraction free environment is essential for an enjoyable experience. 
            I find it very sad and depressing when I see people stare at their phone while they're watching 
            a movie. Or leave to grab a snack and keep the movie running. This is a completely different 
            experience of the movie than the filmmakers intended. I know it can be fun to not take it so 
            seriously and just chill and watch something, but at least try to do this only with certain movies.
             For example, low-budget b-horror movies, that are so bad that you just watch it to make fun of it.
              Then I can understand how this approach might work.<br><br>
              But if watching something serious, try leaving your phone someplace you can't reach 
              so you're not tempted to check it. If you're watching on a laptop, 
              also turn off your notifications there and don't do anything else other than 
              watch the movie, Fullscreen. Try to create the experience of a cinema, 
              so unless you absolutely have to, don't pause the movie to grab a snack or to go to the bathroom. 
              Do this beforehand so your experience is uninterrupted.<br><br>And that's about it. I've added pictures of some movie-setups I think are nice, for inspiration.
