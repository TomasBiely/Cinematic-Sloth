<div class="Subtitle1"><h3>From our research we found that 57% of students mention Netflix as their primary source for watching movies.<br><br>
We also found that 70% of them want to improve their ‘movie watching’ experience.</h3></div>

 <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">So, what can we do about that? I hope while reading this article you won't think I'm sounding "snobbish" and that 
     I'm trying to tell you what to do. These are just tips or my way of looking at it. Let’s dive deeper and discover what 
     watching movies is all about. The rise of film is dated on the break of the 19th and 20th century. 
     It has therefore only been around 130 years since this medium even exists. Early movies, being silent, 
     were easy to understand and they appealed mostly to a "working-class" group of people, often immigrants. But over the years 
     that has of course changed, and movies have become a part of our everyday life. We watch them alone, with friends, 
     family, at home, in the cinema, in a train... And they can literally change our lives, make us feel something, motivate us, 
     help us deal with sadness, the list could go on. In the future we might see movies evolve and grow into something new. 
     But for now, let's focus on why it is important to pick the movies we watch.</p></div>

    <div class="Subtitle2">What happens to our HEARTS when we watch a movie?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">
    A study, conducted by researchers from UCL’s Department of Experimental Psychology 
    has shown that watching movies can improve health. While watching a film in a cinema, 
    the heart rates of the audience members were between 40-80% of their maximum heart rate, which 
    is what the British Heart Foundation calls the “healthy heart zone”. <br>This “emotional arousal” that we feel 
    can be considered as the thing that makes movies feel “magical”. It is what allows us to relate to characters 
    and to feel for them when they are in love or to be scared when they are scared; even though we know that 
    we are watching actors on a screen that are only pretending. It’s weird but it’s great. 
    This is especially true when you are in an actual cinema without distractions and enjoying a movie to its full 
    potential with other people that are doing the same thing. It is not as true when you are watching a movie at 
    home on a laptop while also doing something else and keeping it as just a background noise while looking at your phone.

        “Oh okay, I know where this is going, you want us to go to the cinema more often. 
        But there is no money for that.” - you are probably thinking. I know how it is, trust me. 
        Times are changing, technology is evolving, and it is just not as easy and possible 
        for us to go to the cinema compared to watching a movie at home. Let’s focus on how 
        we can improve our experience of watching movies at home.<br><br>
        Netflix can be great, but I also feel it lacks depth and maximum engagement.
        It has a lot of content which can be overwhelming when choosing what to watch.
        Therefore, I don't think that you should pick your movies on Netflix by browsing, at least not solely.
        You should try to be a more demanding viewer and care for the movie you are watching.
        Who directed the movie? What year it came out and what other films came out the same year?
        What else happened that year or prior years that could have affected the making of this film? 
        What was the budget? <br><br>
        These are just some of the questions I think we should be asking when picking a movie. 
        This can unlock within us a new way of looking at certain films. 
        Films that otherwise maybe we wouldn't have watched, or we wouldn't have considered to be good.
         Film Noir movies that came out in the 1940s or movies only known amongst certain communities.
          For example, black cinema of the 60s. Netflix is designed to attract you to wanting to watch 
          more of what it thinks you like and to spend as much time in there as possible. If you would 
          only turn it on after you've decided on the movie you are gone watch (presuming that movie is on Netflix),
           they would lose this power over you, and you could put more thought into the movies you 
           watch and be happier with the experience. 
        </p></div>
        <br><br><br>
    <div class="Subtitle2">What to watch though and where?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="paragraph1"><p id="article-text">
        You can watch anything that you find interesting, but I would challenge you
         to watch movies out of your usual comfort zone and experiment with different genres, 
         periods, countries. Try to look into lists of recommended movies for filmmakers or 
         lists of movies just from one director and watch all of them to see a pattern or a progression. 
         I also recommend you keep a film journal. Either an actual physical one, where you can
          write down the Title, year, actors, director, short synopsis, your feelings about the movie, 
          etc... or another way to do it is on Letterboxd.com. It is pretty much a website for film nerds, 
          that serves as a journal and a community of people who recommend movies to each other; you can also
           keep track of your friend’s film journals, and much more.<br><br>
           When it comes to the question of "where", things get a little more complicated.
            I am bashing on Netflix here I know, but as long as you have a Netflix subscription 
            and the movie that you want to watch is on it, then by all means, use it. In the other 
            case, there's multiple options. For example, one of my favourites is Mubi.com. It's 
            also a streaming platform like Netflix, but the selection of their films is a lot 
            more exclusive and more oriented towards demanding viewers. Another great one is 
            riterionchannel.com, now Criterion is one of those companies that make this world a 
            better place. Their primary focus is on restoring old films and publishing them in 
            remastered condition that comes as close to the original filmmaker's intention as possible. 
            You can also buy premium quality blu-rays from The Criterioin Collection, but since this
             sounds a bit too expensive for the general audience, the thing I'm stressing here is their 
             streaming platform Criterionchannel. You'll find some of the best films there are in this 
             world with a premium experience on criterion. Another one that I don't know much about but 
             might be worth your time is fandor.com, another streaming platform for cinephiles. I'm not 
             going to endorse movie pirating here, but if you know what you're doing that is also a way to find a movie. <br><br>

             In the grand scheme of things, what I'm saying here is if you can find the time and strength,
              then be a demanding viewer and care about the movies you watch. Because 
              "being actively engaged with something increases the quality of the thing that you're engaged with." 
              Therefore, also the quality of your time.
